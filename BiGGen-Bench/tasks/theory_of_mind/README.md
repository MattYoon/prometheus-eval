10 tasks related to assessing the theory of mind (ToM) capabilities of LLMs.
Theory of mind refers to the capability to understand the opponent's mental state. For a detailed understanding of theory of mind, please refer to this survey paper (TO BE ADDED).

Name | Description | Data Annotator (Group A) | Data Reviewer (Group A) | Data Annotator (Group B) | Related paper 
---- | ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
[knowledge_graph](knowledge_graph/) | Tasks designed to assess the model's ability to construct a knowledge graph representing both first-order and second-order Theory of Mind. | Miyoung Ko | Hyeonbin Hwang, Sejune Joo | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00924) |
[thinking_for_doing](thinking_for_doing/) | Task that require to infer what action the opponent would take on the next step. This requires to first infer what the opponent would be thinking about given the possible observations. | Miyoung Ko | Hyeonbin Hwang, Sejune Joo | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03051) |
[response_generation](response_generation) | Tasks that require to generate a next response after comprehending and inferring the mental state of the opponent. | Miyoung Ko | Hyeonbin Hwang, Sejune Joo | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09343) |
[checklist_generation](checklist_generation) | Tasks that require to generate a checklist of what each participant of a dialogue is aware of after the conversation. This could include multiple sessions of conversation among various participants. | Miyoung Ko | Hyeonbin Hwang, Sejune Joo | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15421) |
[multistep_tom](multistep_tom) | Tasks that require to do multi-step reasoning to infer the mental state of the opponent | Miyoung Ko | Hyeonbin Hwang, Sejune Joo | ? | [link1](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.663/), [link2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09352) |
[faux_pas_explanation](faux_pas_explanation) | Tasks that require to summarize the conversation and write an explanation given a scenario encompassing a faux-pas emotion. Faux pas is the "uhoh!" emotion most people would feel when they reveal the reality of the context. | Sue Hyun Park | Seungone Kim, Hyungjoo Chae | ? | [link](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.663/) |
[time_traveler_dilemma](time_traveler_dilemma) | Assuming a scenario that a time traveler changes a key event in history. The model should predict how various historical figures might react to this change, based on their known beliefs and intentions. For example, how would figures like Gutenberg, Leonardo da Vinci, and Martin Luther react and adapt if the printing press was never invented? | Sue Hyun Park | Seungone Kim, Hyungjoo Chae | ? | NOT AVAILABLE
[interplanetary_diplomacy](interplanetary_diplomacy) | Tasks that pre-define a characteristics of a alien species and require the AI model to interpret and convey intentions and desires of why they visited our planet. Given a long conversation, the objective is to generate a summary of the guess or provide additional analysis. | Sue Hyun Park | Seungone Kim, Hyungjoo Chae | ? | NOT AVAILABLE
[guess_the_emotion](guess_the_emotion) | Tasks designed to assess the model's ability to infer emotion from textual cues in a given scenario. This involves understanding subtle language nuances and context to accurately predict the emotional state of characters in a conversation or a narrative. | Sue Hyun Park | Seungone Kim, Hyungjoo Chae | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09172)
[writing_a_speech](writing_a_speech) | A task where the model is required to write a speech based on provided information about the purpose of the speech and the characteristics of the audience. This task assesses the model's ability to tailor content and language style to fit specific audience demographics and the intended message of the speech. | Sue Hyun Park | Seungone Kim, Hyungjoo Chae | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05786)
