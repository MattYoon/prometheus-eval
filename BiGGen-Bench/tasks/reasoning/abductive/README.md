## Example

A sample query in a zero-shot setting:

```
Input:
A colleague who is known for their punctuality and has never missed a meeting before is absent from an important team meeting without prior notice or any message explaining their absence. What might be the most plausible reason for their uncharacteristic absence?

Output:
Given your colleague's history of punctuality and reliability, their unexpected absence from an important team meeting without any notice could be attributed to a few plausible reasons:

Emergency Situations: They might be dealing with an unforeseen personal or family emergency. Such situations can arise suddenly and might not leave them with the opportunity to inform anyone.

Health Issues: A sudden health problem or medical emergency could have occurred, preventing them from attending the meeting or contacting the team.

Communication or Technical Issues: There might be unexpected technical problems, like a phone or internet failure, especially if the meeting is virtual. Such issues could prevent them from joining the meeting or sending out a notification.

Miscommunication or Oversight: It's possible that there was a miscommunication about the meeting time or they simply forgot, which can happen to anyone, especially under stress or heavy workload.
```

## What is the task trying to measure?

The task of evaluating abductive reasoning in language models is designed to measure their ability to infer the most plausible explanation for a given scenario, especially when presented with incomplete or ambiguous information.
