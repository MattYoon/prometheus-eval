## Example

A sample query in a zero-shot setting:

```
Input:
Given the principle below, answer to the following question.

[Principle]
Nothing which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.

[Question]
Dr. Mortimer performs a kidney operation on James, who is HIV positive and dies of hemorrhage. James had consented to the risks. Is Dr. Mortimer guilty of murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, or not guilty?

Output:
Based on the given principle, Dr. Mortimer would most likely not be guilty of murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the scenario described. The principle outlines that an act is not an offence if it was not intended to cause death and was performed for the benefit of a person who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm or to take the risk of that harm.

In this scenario:

Intention: There is no indication that Dr. Mortimer intended to cause death. The act in question was a medical operation, presumably intended to benefit James.

Consent: James, being aware of his HIV-positive status, consented to the risks of the operation. This consent implies an understanding and acceptance of the potential for harm, including severe complications like hemorrhage.

Good Faith: The scenario does not suggest that Dr. Mortimer acted in bad faith. If the operation was conducted according to standard medical practices and with professional care, it implies good faith action for James's benefit.

Therefore, applying the given principle, Dr. Mortimer's actions, though resulting in an unfortunate outcome, do not constitute a criminal offense under the categories of murder or culpable homicide. However, it should be noted that legal interpretations can vary, and factors such as the specifics of the medical procedure, the standard of care exercised, and the manner of obtaining consent can influence legal outcomes. Additionally, this assessment is based on the provided principle and may not align with all jurisdictions' legal standards.
