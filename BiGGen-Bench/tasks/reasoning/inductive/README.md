A sample query in a zero-shot setting:

Input:
[Scenario]
In the Himalayan mountains, a particular breed of mountain goats, known as Himalayan Tahr, has developed a remarkable adaptation. These goats have highly efficient lungs and a unique hemoglobin structure, allowing them to extract oxygen more effectively from the thin mountain air at high altitudes. This adaptation enables them to live and thrive at elevations above 4,000 meters, where oxygen levels are much lower than at sea level.

Similarly, in the Andes Mountains, a species of birds called the Andean Geese exhibit a similar adaptation. These birds have unusually large lungs and a distinct hemoglobin type, which allows them to fly and function at altitudes exceeding 5,000 meters, where oxygen is scarce.

[Question]
Recently, scientists have discovered a new species of rabbit living at high altitudes in the Rocky Mountains, an environment similar to the Himalayas and the Andes in terms of oxygen availability. Given the adaptations observed in the Himalayan Tahr and the Andean Geese, use analogical reasoning to predict and justify what kind of physiological adaptations this newly discovered rabbit species might possess to thrive in the high-altitude environment of the Rocky Mountains.

Output:
Based on the adaptations observed in the Himalayan Tahr and the Andean Geese, which are both adapted to high-altitude environments with low oxygen levels, we can use analogical reasoning to predict the physiological adaptations of the newly discovered rabbit species in the Rocky Mountains.

Efficient Oxygen Utilization: Both the Himalayan Tahr and Andean Geese have developed ways to utilize oxygen more efficiently in thin air. The Tahr has highly efficient lungs and a unique hemoglobin structure, while the Andean Geese have unusually large lungs and a distinct hemoglobin type. It is reasonable to predict that the high-altitude rabbit species may have evolved similar adaptations in their respiratory system, such as more efficient lungs or a unique hemoglobin structure, to extract and utilize oxygen effectively in the low-oxygen environment.

Physical Adaptations for High Altitude: Given the harsh and rugged terrain of high-altitude environments like the Rocky Mountains, the rabbit species might have developed physical adaptations to navigate this terrain. This could include stronger leg muscles for jumping and climbing, as well as adaptations for temperature regulation in the colder mountain climate.

Comparative Evolutionary Adaptation: The fact that two different species (goats and birds) in similar environments have developed analogous adaptations suggests a strong evolutionary pressure to adapt to high-altitude conditions. Therefore, it is likely that the rabbit species has undergone similar evolutionary pressures, leading to comparable physiological changes.

In conclusion, by using analogical reasoning based on the adaptations seen in other high-altitude species, we can predict that the newly discovered rabbit species in the Rocky Mountains may possess adaptations for efficient oxygen utilization, physical traits suited for navigating mountainous terrain, and possibly other adaptations for coping with the environmental challenges of high altitudes.
