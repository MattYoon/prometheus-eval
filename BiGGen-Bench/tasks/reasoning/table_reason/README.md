| Product ID | Product Name    | Category   | Quantity Sold | Sale Price | Date of Sale |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alpha Smartphone| Electronics | 20           | $299       | 2024-01-10   |
| 2          | Bravo Headphones| Electronics | 15           | $99        | 2024-01-11   |
| 3          | Charlie T-Shirt | Apparel     | 30           | $19        | 2024-01-12   |
| 4          | Delta Blender   | Home Goods  | 10           | $89        | 2024-01-13   |
| 5          | Echo Sneakers   | Apparel     | 25           | $129       | 2024-01-14   |
| 6          | Foxtrot Novel   | Books       | 40           | $15        | 2024-01-15   |
| 7          | Golf Umbrella   | Accessories | 18           | $25        | 2024-01-16   |
| 8          | Hotel Backpack  | Accessories | 20           | $49        | 2024-01-17   |

Question: Based on the above table, how much of the more revenue was generated by the sale of electronics items over that of accessories?

ANSWER: 

Output:
Total revenue made by sale of electronics is 20 * 299 + 15 * 99 = 5980 + 1485 = 7465
Total revenue made by sale of apparael is 30 * 19 + 25 * 129 = 570 + 3225 = 3795
So the difference is 7465 - 3795 = 3670. The answer is $3670.

## What is the task trying to measure?

The task tries to evaluate the model's reasoning capability in handling structured data, specifically in forms of table. It consists of problems that require advanced multi-step reasoning skills, demanding not just the retrieval of relevant data from the table but also the integration and manipulation of information from various data points.

## Motivation

Tables are a common format for organizing and presenting data due to their clarity and efficiency in displaying information. Humans interpret and act upon various data pieces present in this structured information to draw meaningful conclusions. Similarly, we aim to ensure that the model can not only understand the layout and content of tables but also perform complex, multi-step reasoning with the data. This specifically includes accurately performing mathematical operations, recognizing patterns, and making logical deductions. 

The tables are generated using GPT4, while the questions are crafted manually.
