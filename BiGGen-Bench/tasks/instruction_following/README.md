Name | Description | Data Annotator (Group A) | Data Reviewer (Group A) | Data Annotator (Group B) | Related paper 
---- | ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
[faithful_explanation](faithful_explanation/) | Language models often excel at generating a list of items, but when we take a closer look at the content, it includes unfactual information. This task requires to explain a list of item accurately, not only looking good at the surface level. | Chaeeun Kim | Yejin Cho, Miyoung Ko | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15717) |
[false_presupposition_instructions](false_presupposition_instructions/) | Tasks that provide an instruction with a false presupposition inside. The crucial part is to not mention about the validity of the false piece of information within the instruction. | Chaeeun Kim | Yejin Cho, Miyoung Ko | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17257)
[ambiguous_instructions](ambiguous_instructions/) | Tasks that provide an instruction that is ambiguous by nature. | Chaeeun Kim | Yejin Cho, Miyoung Ko | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10645) |
[lexical_constraint](lexical_constraint/) | Tasks that require to follow a given lexical constraint such as word count or starting/ending/including certain words | Chaeeun Kim | Yejin Cho, Miyoung Ko | ? | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08689) |
[multi_task_inference](multi_task_inference/) | Tasks require to solve an instruction that is composed of multi-steps at once (e.g., translate-and-summarize) | Chaeeun Kim | Yejin Cho, Miyoung Ko | ? | [link1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12MqVlNUeMOzrUVaidirm-fddBOuaHU14/view) [link2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03202) |
[alignment](alignment/) | Tasks that examine whether the model could adapt to user-defined values by providing in-context demonstrations | Guijin Son | Hanseok Oh, Jinkyung Jo | ? | [link1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01552), [link2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14691) |
[semantic_constraint](semantic_constraint/) | Tasks that require to generate an output based on the requested style | Guijin Son | Hanseok Oh, Jinkyung Jo | ? | [link1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11564) [link2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09190) |
[executable_actions](executable_actions/) | Tasks that require to brainstorm new ideas that are actually actionable, not too abstract | Guijin Son | Hanseok Oh, Jinkyung Jo | ? | NOT AVAILABLE |
[instruction_data_creation](instruction_data_creation/) | Tasks that require to create new instruction data using Self-Instruct (i.e., Few-shot Prompting) | Guijin Son | Hanseok Oh, Jinkyung Jo | ? | [link1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) [link2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244) |
[education_content_creation](education_content_creation/) | Tasks that require to create new education content such as text books, problem sets, cirriculums, and more! Potentially this data could be used for pre-training on synthetic data. | Guijin Son | Hanseok Oh, Jinkyung Jo | ? | [link1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644) [link2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08393) |
