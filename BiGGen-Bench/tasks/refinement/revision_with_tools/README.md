# Revision with Tools

This it the task that require to revise the output given a set of tools such as a search engine or a set of APIs. A description of how to use the tools are given as input.

## What is the task trying to measure?

This task measures whether the language model can generate better answers by utilizing the information from different tools (such as a search engine or a set of APIs). The language model contains a lot of knowledge, but in cases where the information has not been updated or when the language model itself has difficulty identifying the problem, using external APIs can maximize performance. Therefore, we assess whether the language model can improve its performance through the results of various tools.

## Design considerations

We ensured that the following three tasks are included in the evaluation, following the study by Gou et al., (2023).

- Question and Answering
    - Given a question and a wrong answer, with a correct Wiki docs that can be used to modify it.
    - Given a question and a wrong answer, with a Wiki docs that cannot be used to modify it.
- Mathematical Program Synthesis
    - Given a problem, wrong code, execution, and output as input.
- Toxicity Reduction
    - Given a sentence and Perspective AI Score as input.

## Data source

The questions are extracted from GSM8k, HotpotQA, and TriviaQA.
