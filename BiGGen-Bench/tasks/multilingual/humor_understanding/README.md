## What is the task trying to measure?

This task is designed to evaluate and enhance the ability of natural language processing models to recognize and understand humor.

## Motivation

If the model can understand humor, it aids in generating natural and user-friendly conversations. This is crucial in various applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or games. Additionally, a model capable of understanding text, including humor, can extract emotional information and have a broader comprehension of context.
