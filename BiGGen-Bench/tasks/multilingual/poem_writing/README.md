# Poem Writing

Tasks that test if the language model could fluently write a poem using the target language (e.g., Haiku).

**Authors:** Jinkyung Jo

## Example

A sample query in a zero-shot setting:

```
Input:
以中秋月圆为, 写一首诗.

Output:
窓外明亮的月光, 仿佛是地上的霜. 抬頭仰望山中的月, 低頭思念故鄉.
```

## What is the task trying to measure?

The primary objective of this task is to assess whether the language model can generate poems in various languages that are grammatically accurate, creatively expressed, and consistently coherent.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for evaluating AI models in the task of composing multilingual poems is to measure their adaptability and creativity across various languages. A model that can understand and generate not only common forms of sentences but also literary expressions in diverse languages is highly important and effective. Such a model plays a crucial role in fostering cross-cultural understanding and facilitating effective communication beyond conventional linguistic boundaries.
