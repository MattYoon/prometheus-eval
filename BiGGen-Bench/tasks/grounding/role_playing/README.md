## Example

A sample query in a zero-shot setting:

```
Input:
As Iron Man, you're attending a high-level scientific conference. A fellow scientist challenges your design of the new arc reactor, claiming it's inefficient and outdated. How do you defend your invention?

Output:
Well, first, it's an honor to be among so many brilliant minds. Now, about the arc reactor. It's not just about raw efficiency; it's about sustainable and clean energy. The design may seem traditional, but the innovation lies in its application and the materials used. The reactor operates on a self-sustaining loop, virtually eliminating energy loss. It's a stepping stone towards a future where clean energy is the norm, not the exception. Plus, let's not forget, it's pretty cool looking, right?
```
